# Lucas-Kanade-Tracking
Home assignment #2.1, Computer Vision course, MS in Data Science, UCU.

### Task 2:
Implement template-matching in Python using SSD, NCC, SAD
### Task 3:
Code Lucas-Kanade algorithm in Python using OpenCV
### Task 4:
Implement pyramidal extension to Lucas-Kanade algorithm
### Task 5:
Test on the 3 datasets from
http://cvlab.hanyang.ac.kr/tracker_benchmark/datasets.html
## Summary
Create a command-line tool in Python that accepts the ROI of the target (the portion of
the image that should be tracked in the video) and the path to the dataset and performs tracking
of the target over the image sequence from the dataset. Visualize the current image and
highlight the targetâ€™s location by a rectangle.
#
Find conditions where tracking is lost, explain why.
